      <p>Creating a dynamic navigation that is responsive sounds dreadful. In this tutorial I am going to demonstrate a way this can be completed.</p>
      <p>The first step is to create our file system. We need an index.html, script.js, and styles.css. Really that’s it to get this functioning. Once those files have been created time to get to work in whatever text editor suits you. I prefer sublime text.</p>
      <p>In our html we want to structure the nav so it’s easy to hide a navigation and show a navigation. This is done by creating two navigations in the html.</p>
      <p>I have set it up like this inside of the body. We have two navs with a unordered list and two links. They will both need to be the same in order to have no changes in the navigation.</p>

      <p>Once we have this set up it’s time to add the actual button we’re going to click to toggle the mobile nav. The way this works is that when we go to a breakpoint of tablet and higher the main nav will be the only thing showing.</p>
